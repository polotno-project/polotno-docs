## Open components — own and customize

These components are installed as source files into your repository. You commit them, edit them, and adapt them to your product. They’re designed to be customized — markup, styles, and behavior are all yours.

Note: we still publish npm components for convenience. These “open components” are an additional option when you want full control and easy customization.

## Add components

Use our CLI to add components; it copies files into your repo (commonly under `./src/components/`).

```bash
# add a few UI components
npx shadcn@latest add http://registry.polotno.com:/r/qr-code.json
```

## Customize

- Edit the component files directly to match your UX, API and business logic
- Because it’s your code, refactors and reviews are straightforward

## Update or remove

- To update, add the component again and compare diffs in Git (cherry‑pick what you need)
- To remove, delete the files and related imports — no special uninstall
