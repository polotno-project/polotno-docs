title: Removing "Powered by Polotno"
description: How to remove the Polotno credit with a paid license
---

## Requirements

**Trial keys always show the "Powered by Polotno" credit.** This branding cannot be removed with trial keys, regardless of configuration.

To remove the credit, you must have a **paid license**.

## How to Remove

Follow all three steps:

### 1. Purchase a Paid License

Get a paid license from [polotno.com/cabinet](https://polotno.com/cabinet/). Trial keys will not work.

### 2. Register Your Domain

Add your domain in the developer dashboard at [polotno.com/cabinet](https://polotno.com/cabinet/). The API key validates against registered domains.

**Important:** Register the exact domain including subdomain (e.g., `app.example.com` vs `example.com`).

### 3. Use the Correct API Key and Configuration

This is **critical**. You must use the API key from your paid license and set `showCredit: false`:

```ts
import { createStore } from 'polotno/model/store';

const store = createStore({
  key: 'YOUR_API_KEY', // Must be from your paid license, not a trial key
  showCredit: false,
});
```

For frameworkless integrations:

```ts
import { createDemoApp } from 'polotno/polotno-app';

const { store } = createDemoApp({
  container: document.getElementById('root'),
  key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  showCredit: false,
});
```

## Troubleshooting

If the credit still appears:

- **Verify your API key** - Confirm you're using the key from your paid license (check in [Polotno Cabinet](https://polotno.com/cabinet/))
- **Check domain registration** - Ensure your exact domain is listed in the dashboard
- **Confirm `showCredit: false`** - Make sure it's explicitly set in your configuration
- **Clear cache** - Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

The most common issue is using a trial API key instead of a paid license key.
