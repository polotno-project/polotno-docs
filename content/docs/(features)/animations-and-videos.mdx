## How to enable animation support?

```ts
import { unstable_setAnimationsEnabled } from 'polotno/config';

unstable_setAnimationsEnabled(true);
```

When you enable animations, Polotno will add additional UI in the toolbar to change animation properties of the selected object, show a “Videos” side panel with a library of stock videos, and adapt the Pages component with scene preview.

You can preview animations and export an animated scene as a GIF on the client side programmatically:

```ts
store.play();
store.stop();
await store.saveAsGIF();
```

## Video Export Options

Polotno supports two methods for exporting animated designs to MP4 video:

### Client-Side Video Export

For browser-based video generation without a server, use the `@polotno/video-export` package. All encoding happens directly in the user's browser:

```bash
npm install @polotno/video-export
```

```ts
import { storeToVideo } from '@polotno/video-export';

const videoBlob = await storeToVideo({
  store,
  fps: 30,
  pixelRatio: 2,
  onProgress: (progress) => {
    console.log(`Progress: ${Math.round(progress * 100)}%`);
  },
});

// Download the video
const url = URL.createObjectURL(videoBlob);
const link = document.createElement('a');
link.href = url;
link.download = 'video.mp4';
link.click();
```

Export speed depends on user hardware. High FPS or complex designs may take longer to process.

See the full [Video Export documentation](/docs/video-export) for complete API reference and live demo.

### Server-Side Video Export

For production-grade video rendering with consistent performance, use the [Cloud Render API](/docs/cloud-render-api). This option provides faster rendering and doesn't depend on client device capabilities.

## Audio Support

Add background music or sound effects to your animated designs. Audio tracks sync with the video timeline and export together with animations.

See the [Audio documentation](/docs/audio) for complete details on adding and managing audio tracks.
