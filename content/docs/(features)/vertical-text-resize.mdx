title: Vertical Text Resize
description: Enable vertical resizing for text elements and control vertical alignment
---

**Important:** this is an experimental feature, please proceed with caution. We're kindly asking you to report any bugs and follow the [changelog](https://community.polotno.com/c/changelog/) for the most recent updates.

By default, you can't change **height** of **text** elements. Texts are always updating their own height to fit content. To modify it, consider setting a bounding box for text elements and replacing text content dynamically on the backend later on.

When vertical resize is enabled you can also set vertical align from the text toolbar.

### How to enable vertical text resize?

```ts
import { unstable_setTextVerticalResizeEnabled } from 'polotno/config';

unstable_setTextVerticalResizeEnabled(true);
```
