title: Page Bleed
description: Show and export bleed area around pages
---

In printing, bleed is printing that goes beyond the edge of where the sheet will be trimmed.

Polotno has native support for bleed. Every page has its own `bleed` property. By default bleeds are not visible on the workspace and export. To show bleed on the canvas:

```ts
store.activePage.set({ bleed: 20 }); // set bleed in pixels

// show bleed area on the <Workspace />
store.toggleBleed(true);
```

The canvas will have special space around the page where elements can extend beyond the trim line.

## Exporting with Bleed

By default, exports do not include the bleed area. Use `includeBleed` option to export with bleed:

```ts
// export PDF with bleed
await store.saveAsPDF({ includeBleed: true });

// export image with bleed
await store.saveAsImage({ includeBleed: true });

// as data URL
await store.toDataURL({ includeBleed: true });
```

For detailed information on PDF exports with bleed and crop marks, see [PDF Export](/docs/pdf-export).
