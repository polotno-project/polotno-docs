title: User Roles
description: Switch between admin and user modes to control editing capabilities
---

Different user roles in **Polotno Editor** will change UI and behavior of the application for specific use cases.

Currently Polotno has two roles — **admin** and **user**.

```ts
store.setRole('admin');
```

When **admin** mode is enabled a user will be able to select any element on the canvas (even if it is marked as `selectable: false`). There are also extra settings available for every element on the canvas:

You can use admin mode to set restrictions on elements, for example:

1. Put an element on top and turn `selectable` off. Regular users will not be able to move/delete such elements.
2. Toggle off `showInExport` for some elements. They will not be visible in image or PDF exports.
3. Fine‑tune locking of elements. For example toggle off “can change style” on a text element, so users can't change its font, color, etc.
