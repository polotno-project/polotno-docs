title: Remove Image Background
description: Enable AI-powered background removal in the Polotno editor UI
---

Polotno provides built-in UI for removing image backgrounds using AI. This feature integrates with the [Remove Background API](/docs/remove-background-api) and appears in the image toolbar.

## Availability

- **Business plan**: Enabled by default
- **Team plan**: Available on request (contact support)
- **Pricing**: Additional usage charges apply. See [pricing details](https://polotno.com/sdk/pricing) for rates

## Disable the Feature

If you want to hide the "Remove Background" button from the toolbar (even on Business plan):

```tsx
import { Toolbar } from 'polotno/toolbar/toolbar';

<Toolbar
  store={store}
  components={{
    ImageRemoveBackground: () => null,
  }}
/>
```

## Requirements

1. **API Key**: Valid Polotno API key with Business plan (or Team plan with feature enabled)
2. **Network Access**: Internet connectivity required to call the cloud API

## How It Works

Once enabled, users will see a "Remove Background" button in the image element toolbar. Clicking it:

1. Sends the image to Polotno's cloud API
2. Processes the image with AI background removal
3. Returns a transparent PNG
4. Updates the canvas element with the result

For programmatic background removal without the UI, use the [Remove Background API](/docs/remove-background-api) directly:

```ts
const req = await fetch(
  'https://api.polotno.com/api/remove-image-background?KEY=YOUR_API_KEY',
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ url: 'path-to-image' }),
  }
);
const res = await req.json();
// returns base64 data URL with transparent background
const newImageURL = res.url;
```

<Callout type="warn">
**Image Storage**: By default, the API returns a base64-encoded image which is saved directly into your design JSON. This increases JSON size significantly. **It is strongly recommended** to upload the processed image to your own cloud storage and store only the URL in the design JSON.
</Callout>

Example with cloud upload:

```ts
// after getting the base64 result
const res = await req.json();
const base64Image = res.url;

// upload to your cloud storage
const uploadedURL = await uploadToYourCloud(base64Image);

// update the element with the cloud URL instead of base64
element.set({ src: uploadedURL });
```

## Limitations

- Internet connection required
- Processing time varies based on image size and complexity
- Works best with clear subject separation from background

## Error Handling

If the API call fails (network error, quota exceeded, invalid key), users will see an error message in the UI. Ensure your API key is valid and your subscription is active.

## Security & Privacy

**Data Storage**: Polotno does not store processed images. All images are processed transiently and deleted immediately after processing.

**Third-Party Service**: Background removal uses [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) as the processing provider. By using this feature, processed images are sent to Replicate's infrastructure.

**Terms**: Review [Replicate's Terms of Service](https://replicate.com/terms) if you have compliance requirements about where image data is processed.
