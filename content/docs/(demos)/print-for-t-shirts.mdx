title: Print for T‑shirts
description: Build a white‑label shirt designer and export print‑ready files
---

A lot of merch platforms need a simple, white‑label canvas where customers can drop graphics on a shirt, then download a print‑ready file. Polotno lets you ship that in a day. Below is the approach we used in the live demo.

For t‑shirt background, we use image elements like this:

```ts
frontPage.addElement({
  type: 'svg',
  src: '/front.svg',
  width: 2500,
  height: 2500,
  x: -750,
  y: -400,
  showInExport: false,
  selectable: false,
});
```

That way, the background image is not selectable and will be excluded from the final export.
