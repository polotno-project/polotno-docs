title: Grid UI
description: Build a grid overlay using SVG and snapping helpers
---

**Polotno** doesn't offer built-in support for a grid API or UI directly. However, you can utilize Polotno's existing elements to construct a grid UI. Additionally, invisible elements can be placed on the canvas to facilitate snapping to specific positions.

Another approach is to overlay an `svg` element on the canvas to display a grid. This requires dynamically generating the `svg` content based on the desired grid size.
