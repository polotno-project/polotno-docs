title: Overlays and watermarks
description: Control element behavior with selectable, alwaysOnTop, and showInExport
---

In graphic design, controlling the behavior of elements is crucial for creating professional and efficient designs. Special properties like `selectable: false`, `alwaysOnTop: true`, and `showInExport: false` provide flexibility to manage overlays, watermarks, and guides seamlessly within your projects.

Common use cases:

- **Watermarks**: Protect designs while keeping them non-interactive.
- **Overlays**: Display information or graphics that stay visible without interfering with design interaction.
- **User Tips**: Provide guidance within the design that doesn't export with the final product.
- **Cutting Edges**: Keep guide marks visible only during the design process.

Here is how you can create such elements:

```ts
store.activePage.addElement({
  type: 'image',
  src: 'path-to-your-watermark-or-overlay.png',
  // make it non-selectable
  selectable: false,
  // keep it always on top
  alwaysOnTop: true,
  // hide it in export
  showInExport: false,
});
```

## Example

In the demo we add a dashed red shape on top of the design and make it non-selectable, always on top, and not visible in export. A regular user can't change it, but it is visible on the screen. You can use a special "admin" role to allow users to interact with such elements. See [Roles](https://polotno.com/docs/user-roles) for more details.
