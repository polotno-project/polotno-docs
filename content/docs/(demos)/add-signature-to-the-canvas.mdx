title: Add Signature to the Canvas
description: Build a custom drawing UI and insert signature as image or SVG
---

In **Polotno** you cannot draw directly on the canvas. But you can create your own custom UI for drawing operations, and then add the result to the canvas using `image` or `svg` elements.

In this demo, we create a custom side panel to add a signature to the document.
