title: Page Bleed
description: Show and export bleed area around pages for print-ready designs
---

In printing, bleed is printing that goes beyond the edge of where the sheet will be trimmed.

Polotno has native support for bleed. Every page has its own `bleed` property. By default bleeds are not visible on the workspace and export. Also bleed doesn't affect the inner part of the page. To show bleed on the canvas you can do this:

```ts
store.activePage.set({ bleed: 20 }); // set bleed in pixels

// show bleed area on the <Workspace />
store.toggleBleed(true);
```

The canvas will have special space around the page.
