Showing line, bar, pie charts on the canvas.

There are several tools that will help you display and change charts in Polotno Editor:

1. Using an SVG library to generate an SVG image of a chart.
2. With the `svg` element you can show the generated SVG image on the canvas.
3. Use the `custom` attribute of the `svg` shape to save any additional data into the element. You can use it to store chart data for future reference.
