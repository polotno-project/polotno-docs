title: Page Numbers on Canvas
description: Automatically render page numbers on the canvas and keep them in sync

What if you want to automatically add page numbers to your document?

Usually most elements in the store are controlled by the user. But with Polotno you can create your own elements and fully control them programmatically. In this demo we add a special hook to show page numbers directly on the canvas.

Instructions: Check the number on the first page. Try to add/reorder/remove pages, and you will see page numbers updated automatically.
