## How to enable animation support?

```ts
import { unstable_setAnimationsEnabled } from 'polotno/config';

unstable_setAnimationsEnabled(true);
```

When you enable animations, Polotno will add additional UI in the toolbar to change animation properties of the selected object, show a “Videos” side panel with a library of stock videos, and adapt the Pages component with scene preview.

You can preview animations and export an animated scene as a GIF on the client side programmatically:

```ts
store.play();
store.stop();
await store.saveAsGIF();
```

To export the design into a final MP4 video, use the [Cloud Render API](https://polotno.com/docs/cloud-render).
