## How to save additional metadata into a design?

In some use cases, you may want to save your own data into the store/page/element. You may want to save:

- Name of the design
- Design id
- Custom page properties
- Element metadata

For such use cases, you can use the `custom` attribute. It is available for all nodes in the store: the store itself, any page, any element.

```ts
// set custom data
element.set({
  custom: {
    // optionally, keep previous custom data
    ...element.custom,
    // save new data
    price: 10,
  },
});

// read custom data
// notice that by default element.custom will be null
const price = element.custom?.price;

// also you can save metadata into a page
page.set({
  custom: {
    ...page.custom,
    reference: 'sample',
  },
});

// or into store
store.set({
  custom: {
    productId: 'some-id',
  },
});
```

`custom` must be an object `{}`. You can write any data into that object. Polotno never uses it for rendering, so it is under your control. By default, `custom` will be `null`, so when you read some data from `custom`, make sure it is defined.
