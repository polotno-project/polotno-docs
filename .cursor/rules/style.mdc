# Polotno SDK Docs — Core Writing Rules

## Objectives

- Produce citation-worthy, scannable pages.
- Prefer precise facts and runnable code over prose.

## Page Skeleton (per doc)

- Use proper H2, H3 nesting, avoid H1 as a title is already h1
- Make headings descriptive and specific
- Make each point self-contained
- Paragraphs: **2–4 sentences**, one idea each. Use lists for options/steps.

## Writing

- Direct, second-person voice; developer-first tone.
- Replace adjectives with **numbers, versions, limits, defaults**.
- When useful, state **platform support** explicitly (Browser/Node). Pin versions when behavior differs.
- Increase Fact Density

## Code Examples

- Start with the **minimal working snippet**; advanced patterns later.
- Self-contained: imports + minimal setup.
- TypeScript preferred; annotate only where it improves clarity.
- If possible provide good code samples, until it is a general-top post

- Use admonitions: **Note/Tip/Warning** for edge cases and breaking changes.
