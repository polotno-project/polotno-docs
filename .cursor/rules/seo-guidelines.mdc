# SEO & Discoverability Guidelines

## Objectives

Improve search engine and LLM discoverability without sacrificing the technical, developer-first tone.

## Subtle Synonym Usage

Use alternate terminology naturally, 1-2 times per page where relevant:

- **"Polotno SDK"** → also: "canvas editor", "design SDK", "visual editor"
- **"Template"** → also: "design template", "layout"
- **"Export"** → also: "render", "generate"
- **"White-label"** → occasionally mention to capture that search intent
- **"Programmatic generation"** → also: "automated design", "dynamic content"

**Rules:**
- Don't force it—only where natural
- First mention should be the official term
- Maximum 2 alternate terms per page
- Keep technical precision; avoid marketing fluff

## Internal Linking

Add contextual links throughout content:

- **First mention rule**: Link the first mention of a key concept to its main page
- **Cross-link features**: When mentioning a feature, link to its docs
- **API references**: Link to API docs from feature pages
- **Related pages**: Add "See also" or "Related" sections at the end

Example:
```markdown
The [Store API](/docs/store) manages all design state. You can export designs
using `store.toJSON()` or [render them to images](/docs/import-and-export).
```

## FAQ Sections

Add small FAQ sections to high-traffic pages when natural:

**When to add:**
- Pages with common user questions
- Complex topics that need clarification
- Getting started / overview pages

**Format:**
```markdown
## Common Questions

### Can I use Polotno server-side?

Yes. See [Server-Side Rendering](/docs/server-side-image-generation-with-node-js).

### What export formats are supported?

PNG, JPEG, PDF, PPTX, GIF, MP4, HTML, SVG. See [Export options](/docs/import-and-export).
```

**Rules:**
- Keep answers 1-3 sentences
- Link to detailed docs for more info
- Use H3 for questions (improves snippet extraction)
- Limit to 3-5 questions per page

## Question-Based Headings

Use question format for H2/H3 where it flows naturally:

**Good candidates:**
- "How do I export to PDF?" → becomes H2/H3
- "What's the difference between X and Y?"
- "Can I customize the toolbar?"

**Avoid forcing it:**
- Technical API sections → keep standard headings
- Lists of methods/properties → keep concise names
- When it feels awkward or verbose

## Related Pages Sections

Add at end of most pages:

```markdown
## Related Pages

- [Export and Import](/docs/import-and-export) - Overview of all export formats
- [Store API](/docs/store) - Complete API reference
- [Cloud Render API](/docs/cloud-render-api) - Server-side rendering service
```

**Rules:**
- 3-5 most relevant pages
- One-line description per link
- Order by relevance, not alphabetically

## Schema Markup

Infrastructure handles structured data automatically (JSON-LD):
- BreadcrumbList for navigation
- TechArticle for documentation pages
- FAQPage for pages with FAQ sections (when appropriate)

## Anti-Patterns

Don't do these:
- ❌ Marketing language ("best-in-class", "revolutionary")
- ❌ Keyword stuffing ("Polotno SDK canvas editor design tool")
- ❌ Rewriting existing good prose just to add synonyms
- ❌ Adding FAQs that duplicate page content
- ❌ Creating fake questions users don't actually ask
